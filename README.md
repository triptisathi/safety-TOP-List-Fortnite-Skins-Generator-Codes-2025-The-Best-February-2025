Methods to Obtain Free Fortnite Skins
Seasonal Battle Passes

One of the most reliable ways to get free Fortnite skins is through the seasonal Battle Pass. Each season in Fortnite, which lasts about ten weeks, offers a Battle Pass that players can purchase with V-Bucks. While the initial purchase requires spending money, the Battle Pass allows players to earn V-Bucks by completing challenges and leveling up. These earned V-Bucks can then be used to buy the next season's Battle Pass, essentially allowing players to get free Fortnite skins if they continue to play and complete challenges.
